### US Storm database Analyser

This Shiny application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Dataset can be obtained from [the Coursera Reproducible Research Course site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

It reviews the dataset made available online by the National Weather Service (at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/), spanning over six decades from 1950 until 2011.

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/tehty/DevDataPrd).
